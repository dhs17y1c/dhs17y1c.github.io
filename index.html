 <h1>My Movie Review</h1>
   <h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</h2>
   <p>Harry is a boy who learns on his eleventh birthday from Hagrid, the Hogwarts game master that he had 2 powerful wizarding parent who studied in Hogwarts, an English boarding school for wizards, that had unfortunately passed away. He also found out that he was admitted into Hogwarts and can possess unique magical powers on his own.  At Hogwarts, Harry was sorted by the sorting hat into Gryffindor. Harry met many friends, some who became his closest allies, and some who became his greatest enemies. Together, they discovered many truth about his parents’ death, learning that they were not killed in a car crash, but by one of the most powerful and most evil wizard, Lord Voldemort. In the ending part of the story, Harry came face to face with Lord Voldemort and had a duel with him after finding the Philosopher’s Stone.</p>
   <h2>Review</h2>
   <p>Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a Cloak of Invisibility.All he knows is a miserable life with the dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley- a spoilt child.Then on his 11th birthday, he found out he got admitted to Hogwarts, a wizarding school. After entering school, he meets many friends and finds many truths.From Hagrid, Harry and his best friends, Ron and Hermione, learn about the Philosopher’s Stone and decided to go find the Philosopher’s Stone.</p>
